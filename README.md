# PDF Merger

Script to merge PDFs easily

#### Set up the conda environment

You need to [install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) on your system or [install Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) as well, and substitute `conda` with `mamba` in all following commands.

Update Anaconda if needed by running

```
conda update -n base conda
```

To download the dependencies and create the conda environment, run:

```
conda env create --file environment.yml
```

After, you can activate the new environment with:

```
conda activate pdfMerger
```
